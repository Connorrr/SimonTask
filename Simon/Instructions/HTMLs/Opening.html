    Let’s practice! In this task you will first need to focus on the cross in the centre of the screen.
    <br>Then, you will be shown an arrow that points either left <font size="8">⬅️</font> or points right <font size="8">➡️</font> and will appear on either side of the cross.
    <br>When you see an arrow that points left press the <font size="8">⬅️</font> button. When you see an arrow that points right, press the <font size="8">➡️</font> key.
    <br>Try your best to go as quickly and accurately as possible.
    
    <br><br>Tap anywhere on the screen to begin!
